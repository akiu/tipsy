You will need MySQL and Apache installed for this example.

1. Edit your **config/db.ini** file with your user, host, and database.
2. Open **db/mysql.sql** and load that data into your database.
3. Copy this directory somewhere so **www** is readable by apache.
4. Open the **www** directory in your browser and it should work.
